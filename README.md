1. **Story is visual only** - no text passed to API, only the screenshot
2. **FRANZ reads the HUD window** - his story is at the bottom of the screenshot
3. **Update happens BEFORE screenshot** - story changes, then capture includes new story, then FRANZ sees it and rewrites
4. **Pure visual feedback loop** - screenshot contains both desktop AND story, FRANZ reads both, rewrites story, cycle continues
5. **Small delay after HUD update** - ensures story text is rendered before capture
